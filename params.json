{"name":"PyDecode","tagline":"A simple dynamic programming toolkit for natural language processing.","body":"PyDecode is a dynamic programming toolkit. It is being developed as a\r\nresearch tool for natural language processing. The interface and\r\nvisualization code is written Python, the core algorithms are written in\r\nC++. For full description of the project see the\r\n[documentation](http://pydecode.readthedocs.org/).\r\n\r\nMotivation\r\n==========\r\n\r\nWe built this toolkit because:\r\n\r\n-   Dynamic programming is hard to get right and painful to debug.\r\n-   Run-time efficiency is crucial for many NLP tasks.\r\n-   Extensions to dynamic programming often require extensive extra\r\n    programming.\r\n\r\nThis\r\n[presentation](https://github.com/srush/PyDecode/raw/master/writing/slides/slides.pdf)\r\ndiscusses the background for this work.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n========\r\n\r\nCurrently the toolkit is in early development but should be ready to be\r\nused.\r\n\r\nDynamic programming:\r\n\r\n-   Construction of a dynamic programming algorithms.\r\n-   Graphical output for debugging.\r\n-   Finding the best path, inside scores, outside scores, and oracle\r\n    scores.\r\n-   Pruning based on max-marginals.\r\n-   Integration with an LP solver.\r\n\r\nConstrained dynamic programming:\r\n\r\n-   Hypergraphs with additional constraints.\r\n-   Subgradient-style optimization for constraints.\r\n-   ILP optimization with constraints.\r\n\r\nFuture additions:\r\n\r\n-   Hooks for features and training.\r\n-   Formal A\\* and beam search extensions.\r\n-   K-best algorithms.\r\n\r\nWhile the interface is in Python, the underlying algorithms and data\r\nstructures are written in C++ with Cython bindings. Our aim is to keep\r\nthe C++ codebase as small as possible.\r\n\r\nTutorial and Galleries\r\n======================\r\n\r\nTo get started check out the\r\n[tutorial](http://pydecode.readthedocs.org/en/latest/notebooks/tutorial.html)\r\nand a\r\n[gallery](http://pydecode.readthedocs.org/en/latest/notebooks/tutorial.html)\r\nof examples.\r\n","google":"UA-44854618-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
